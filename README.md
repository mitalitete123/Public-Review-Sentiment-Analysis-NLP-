## About My Project

My project is basicaly a **Sentiment Analysis Web App** built using **Streamlit**, **scikit-learn**, and **NLTK**. The goal is to classify **public reviews** into **positive or negative sentiments** by applying **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

Key features of this project include:

* **Text Preprocessing** – cleaning reviews with tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
* **Feature Extraction** – converting text into numerical form using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.
* **Machine Learning Models** – implementing and comparing **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression** classifiers.
* **Interactive Web App** – users can upload datasets, train models, view evaluation metrics (accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix), and test with custom reviews in real-time.
* **Demo Dataset** – the app also provides a built-in sample dataset (Movie Reviews from NLTK) for quick testing.

My project demonstrates how NLP pipelines can be combined with ML models to analyze customer feedback, making it useful for businesses to understand **public opinion, customer satisfaction, and product feedback**.
